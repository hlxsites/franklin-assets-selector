## Extending the Assets Selector Capabilities

To extend the capabilities of the Assets Selector, you can look at the following sample configurations and GitHub repository as a reference. These configurations are hosted on Adobe IO Runtime through App Builder and can be adapted to fit your project needs and extension requirements.

- [Sample Configuration Hosted on Adobe IO Runtime][0]
- [Sample Configuration with Web Path][1]
- [GitHub Reference Implementation][2]

This configuration is particularly useful for extending the Assets Selector capabilities documented [here][3]. Feel free to integrate and customize it as per your projectâ€™s use cases.
